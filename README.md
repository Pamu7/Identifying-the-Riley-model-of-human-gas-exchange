# Identifying-the-Riley-model-of-human-gas-exchange
Project #1, HFU Uni
Your task is to identify a model of human gas exchange and to present the results in a GUI. 
The gas exchange model that is used is a simple mathematical model to predict reactions in 
gas exchanges to changes in minute volume (MV) and inspired oxygen (FiO2) [1]. It describes 
lung gas exchange as a system of three compartments with different distributions of blood and 
air: 
• The dead space compartment, which receives a fraction of the inspired air, but is not 
perfused, i.e. it defines the part of the inspired air that does not participate in gas 
exchange.
• The shunt compartment, which receives a fraction of blood, but is not ventilated, i.e. 
it defines the part of venous blood that is not oxygenated. 
• The lung compartment, which is both ventilated and perfused, i.e. it defines the parts 
of inspired air and venous blood that participate in gas exchange.
